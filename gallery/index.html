    <h1>Kaleidoscopic Pixel Sort</h1>
    <h4>by Karl Yerkes</h4>
    <img src="project1.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This is a pixel sorted image of a kaleidoscope view found within the House of Eternal Return in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
      Kim Asendorf developed "pixel sorting", an visual effect that comes from sorting local regions of a digital image. Meow
      Wolf made the House of Eternal Return.</p>

    <h1>Scene from the Pacific Surfliner</h1>
    <h4>by Karl Yerkes</h4>
    <img src="project2.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This scene is from the Spring of 2019. The picture was taken from the window of the tail car of the Pacific Surfliner Amtrak.
    The ocean view is softened by the pixel sorting effect, but made harsh by the choppy columns of pixels.</p>

    <h1>Cable Glitch</h1>
    <h4>by Karl Yerkes</h4>
    <img src="project3.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This is what happens when you take up close (and blurry) images of a digital television while it glitches. The pixel sorting
    effect adds character.</p>
